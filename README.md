# Dsa 210 project


## Main Purpose of the project

In this project, I will attempt to examine how the consequences of temperature change affect shark behavior and which areas are most likely to be affected. My main goal is to understand how sharks react to climate changes. This way, we can think about when to enter the ocean and feel safer when entering the ocean.  

## Main Objectives:
- Analyzing shark attack data, including country, year, and attack details.
- Enriching the shark attack dataset with temperatrue dataset.
- Exploring potential correlations between rising ocean temperatures and shark attacks.
- Generating visuals that could help us to understand the impact of environmental changes on shark behavior.
